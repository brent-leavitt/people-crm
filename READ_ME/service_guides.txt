Service Guides - READ ME
Last Updated 11 Jan 2019
-------------------------

Service Guides are the sets of instructions that are setup by an administrator to outline what automated tasks the Cron-like system perform on a regular basis. 

These are the only custom post type that is declared at the network level, all other CPT's though used in the network are only declared at a site specific level. (Maybe Invoice and Receipt CPTs should be network-wide...) 

They interact with Enrollment Tokens. (I will offer more information here as they are developed.)
