This document explains how notices/emails/messages are processed in the NB Network. Notices are used as the communication tool throughout the NB Network. They can take different forms: email sent to users or administrator or company reps or messsages sent to the system to be viewed when a user logs in. Sometimes they can be both. Notices can be generated by administrators, users, the system, newsletters, etc. 

Notices are tracked and stored in the People CRM website. 

Every notice has a template, which can be editted from the Notice Templates CPT menu in the respective site. Notices sent are stored in the Notice CPT which is only in the CRM.
